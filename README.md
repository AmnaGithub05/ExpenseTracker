# ExpenseTracker

A minimal JavaScript expense tracking utility.

## Overview

This repository currently contains a single JavaScript file:

- `ExpenseTracker.js` — core script you can drop into a web page or integrate into a larger project.

## Getting Started

### Use in a Web Page

1. Copy `ExpenseTracker.js` into your project.
2. Reference it from your HTML:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
	<head>
		<meta charset="utf-8" />
		<title>ExpenseTracker Demo</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<div id="app"></div>
		<script src="./ExpenseTracker.js"></script>
		<script>
			// Initialize or call into the script here as needed
			// e.g., create elements, wire up inputs, etc.
		</script>
	</body>
	</html>
```

### Run with Node (optional)

If the script includes a runnable example, you can try:

```bash
node ExpenseTracker.js
```
